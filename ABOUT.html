<p>The objective of this project is to develop a motion sensor alarm based on a Passive Infra-Red (PIR) sensor module. There are many vendors that sdasdadad sd
manufacture the PIR sensor modules and almost all of them are pretty much the same in function. PIR sensor detects the changes in the IR levels emit.ddadadadadad 
PIR sensors can detect levels of infrared radiation. In this project, microcontroller continuously monitors the output from the sensor module and t it goes activ The application areas of this project are: All outdoor lights, Lift lobby, Multi apartment complexes, common staircases, for basement or covered parking area,dsd dasdshopping malls, for garden lights. Certain crystalline materials have the property to generate a surface electric charge whinfraredfasddssdsdradiation. This phenomenon is known as pyroelectricity. The presence of human body creates a sudden change in the IR profile of the surrounding that is sensed by thesensor. When the microcontroller detects the sensor is triggered, it drives the buzzer. The sensor is in retriggering mode, the buzzer remains on as long as thecontinuously s
